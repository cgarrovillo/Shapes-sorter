## Shapes-Sorter

### Shape sorting program through various sorting algorithms
Part of CPRG-311 Advanced Object Oriented Programming

- Reads text files and collects shape data to be sorted using a chosen sorting algorithm
- Various Sorting Algorithms implemented
- Comparable/Comparator Implementation
- Benchmarking for each sorting algorithm
- Used in a CLI


### Technologies Used:
1. Sorting Algorithms
 * Bubble Sort
 * Selection Sort
 * Insertion Sort
 * Merge Sort
 * Quick Sort


### Tools Used: 
1. IntelliJ IDEA
2. Java 8

#### Tutorial:

1. Run a command line interface in the directory where Sort.jar is installed
2. run 'java -jar' with these parameters:

-f<filename>
-t<compare type>
* v - compare by volume
* a - compare by area
* h - compare by height
-s<sorting algorithm>
* i - insertion sort
* s - selection sort
* b - bubble sort
* m - merge sort
* q - quick sort
